term project

　

The project basically implements a system call, sys_openfile_size(int N), will report the top N processes according to the total sizes of files currently opened by them.  For example, if you have 10 processes (process 1 to process 10) currently running in the system.  Assuming the total size of files (regardless the number of files) opened by process X (assuming its process id is 2 * X)  is XMB, so process one (pid 2) with 1 MB, process two (pid 4) with 2 MB, etc.  If your test program calls sys_openfile_size(3), it will report information something like the following.  Your system call will update the data once per minute.

18      larry                 9                                 /* process pid 18 with 9 mb */

16      david               8                                 /* process pid  16 with 8 mb */
